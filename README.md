## Lab/Practicals Syllabus:

1. Write a program to generate XOR function using McCulloch-Pitts neuron and appropriate values for weights, bias and threshold.
2. Write a program for perceptron net for an AND function with bipolar inputs and targets.
3. Build a neural network with one hidden layer, using forward propagation and backpropagation.
4. Build an Artificial Neural Network by implementing the Backpropagation algorithm and test the same using appropriate data sets.
5. Build and train deep neural networks, and apply it to computer vision.
6. Implement Hidden Markov Model using Daily and Sports Activities dataset.
7. Implement Convolutional Neural Network for image classification
8. Implement Recurrent Neural Network for object recognition.
9. Build a autoencoder based network.
10. Case Study: Download cars donated by Marco Bohanec in 1997 data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Build a classification model using deep learning based classifier.
